# VISUAL BrainF

This project is currently a minimal, bare BrainF interpreter. Eventually, it will be a full-featured visual BrainF editor _and_ interpreter with a GUI rendered with the Pyglet library.

## Usage:

The script requires one parameter:
```
python Visual_brainf.py --output thing_idk.vbf
```

will execute the BrainF script contained in the `thing_idk.vbf` file.

Installation packages will come in the future. 

Roadmap:
### v0.1:
 * First public release containing a rudimentary Pyglet GUI interface.
